          <h2 class="title is-5">My research interest is focused on fashion. More specifically, I am interested in  people’s relationship with their clothes, and more pressingly the wastefulness and alarming state of the current fast fashion structure and the overall fashion industry. I want to analyze patterns and motivations in consuming clothing through both quantitative and qualitative research and eventually create some sort of physical designed experience –potentially something like a flashcard style set of questions– that would spark conversations regarding clothing consumption motivations and habits. I would also aim to create a supplemental informative resource that is educational on the subject of conscious and slow clothing consumption. </h2>
          <p>Some work that has informed by research interest:</p>
          <p><a href="https://deadwhitemansclothes.org/intro">Liz Ricketts’ work</a> regarding the “used” clothing trade in Accra Ghana. She investigates and explores the ‘mentality that accepts the exportation of waste from the global North to the global South as a solution of any kind.’</p>

            <p>My name is Nayeli Alejandra Pérez Torres. I was born and raised in El Paso, TX and moved to San Antonio to attend Trinity University. In addition to design, I do freelance photography and personal photography work. I enjoy observing, analyzing, and talking about both art and design. I am also interested in fashion, thrifting, new media, and how and why trends come about. Outside of art and design, I enjoy playing and watching soccer (Visca Barça!) and playing the guitar and piano.</p>
